# library-management-pro
This is an advanced version of a Library Management System.

ðŸŸ¢ Phase 1: Basic Microservice Setup
Goal: Get a working microservice with database & simple API

What to Do:
Create a Spring Boot Project using Spring Initializr

Add dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, MySQL Driver, Lombok

Set up MySQL database (local or Docker-based)

Create separate configs for read and write (basic for now)

Implement a simple Book API

Endpoints like: GET /books, POST /books

Write simple unit tests with JUnit

Tools:
Spring Boot

MySQL

Postman

IntelliJ / VS Code

ðŸŸ¡ Phase 2: Security, Logging & API Docs
Goal: Add basic authentication, logs, and documentation

What to Do:
Add JWT-based security with Spring Security

Simple login + token generation

Use roles like ADMIN, USER

Enable Swagger UI

Easy API testing via browser

Add logging with Logback

Later you can integrate ELK (Elastic Stack)

Tools:
Spring Security + JWT

SpringDoc OpenAPI (for Swagger)

ELK stack (later, optional)

ðŸŸ  Phase 3: Kafka, Redis & Testing
Goal: Add message broker & caching, improve tests

What to Do:
Set up Kafka

Install locally or use Docker

Create producer/consumer for book events

Use Redis for caching

Cache GET /books response

Use Spring Boot Redis starter

Write integration tests using TestContainers

Covers DB + Kafka behavior

Start writing end-to-end tests using Playwright (optional for now)

Tools:
Apache Kafka

Redis

Testcontainers

ðŸ”µ Phase 4: Deployment & Scaling
Goal: Make your service production-ready

What to Do:
Dockerize your services

Create Dockerfile for each microservice

Add Rate Limiting + Circuit Breaker

Use Resilience4j

Create basic CI/CD pipeline

GitHub Actions or GitLab CI

Deploy to cloud or localhost Kubernetes (optional)

Tools:
Docker

Resilience4j

GitHub Actions

Kubernetes (optional)

âœ… Final Suggestion:
Once you're done with these steps, your project will include:

Secure REST APIs

Kafka messaging

Redis caching

JWT-based login

Logs & monitoring ready

CI/CD-readyÂ codebase
